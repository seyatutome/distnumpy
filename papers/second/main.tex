Two-Dimensional Block Cyclic Distribution is a very popular distribution scheme and it is used in numerical libraries like ScaLAPACK\cite{Blackford96} and LINPACK\cite{linpack79}. It supports matrices and vectors and has a good load balance in numerical problems that have a diagonal computation workflow e.g. Gaussian elimination. The distribution scheme works by arranging all MPI-processes in a two dimensional grid and then distributing data-blocks in a round-robin fashion either along one or both grid dimensions (Fig. \ref {fig:datalayout}); the result is a well-balanced distribution.

NumPy is not limited to matrices and vectors as it supports arrays with an arbitrary number of dimensions. DistNumPy therefore use a more generalized N-Dimensional Block Cyclic Distribution inspired by High Performance Fortran\cite{Loveman93}, which supports an arbitrary number of dimensions. Instead of using a fixed process grid, we have a process grid for every number of dimensions. This works well when operating on arrays with the same number of dimensions but causes problems otherwise. For instance in a matrix-vector multiplication the two arrays are distributed on different process grid and may therefore require more communication. ScaLAPACK solves the problem by distributing vectors on two-dimensional process grids instead of one-dimensional process grids, but this will result in vector operations that cannot utilize all available processors. An alternative solution is to redistribute the data between a series of identically leveled BLAS operations using a fast runtime redistribution algorithm like \cite{PrylliT97} demonstrates.
