\section{Change list}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed the double title in reference number six (reviewer 1).
\item In the Result section a reference to the Blue Gene/P section has been added (reviewer 3).
\item Extended the introduction with more motivation of the need for supercomputers and why we only focus on the stencil operation (reviewer 1).
\item Added a more thorough discussion of the computation complexity in section 4.1 (reviewer 2).
\item To include a generalization of our optimizations we have introduced a general formula for the amount of time used by waiting on non-hidden communication in section 5.1.2 (reviewer 1).
