== Reusing PyArray objects ==
The idea is to reuse PyArray objects instead of creating completely new objects.
This has been implemented in r53 for blocked universal functions but the performance result was not that great. It is my believe that the object-creation-overhead is too little to really matter.

Some performance benchmark when running on a single CPU-core:
`mpiexec -l -n 1 -env DNPY_BLOCKSIZE 1000 python distnumpy/test/matrix_solvers.py 1 20000 1`
