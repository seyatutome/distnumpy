#summary Installation Guide

== Requirements ==

Beside the requirements described in `INSTALL.txt`, you need a working MPI-2 installation and the MPI-2 installation must expose `mpicc` in `$PATH`.

All MPI-2 implementations should work but there is an issue with OpenMPI (issue 1). At the moment we therefore recommend MPICH2, which is available [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/ her].

== Installation ==

To install DistNumPy run the following command:

`CC="mpicc" python dnumpy/setup.py install --prefix /you/dir/`

And then make sure that `/you/dir/` is in your `$PYTHONPATH`.
