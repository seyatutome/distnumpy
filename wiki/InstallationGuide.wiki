#summary Installation Guide
#labels Phase-Deploy

== Requirements ==

Beside the requirements described in `INSTALL.txt`, you need a working MPI-2 installation and the MPI-2 installation must expose `mpicc` in `$PATH`.

All MPI-2 implementations should work but there is an issue with OpenMPI (issue 1). At the moment we therefore recommend MPICH2, which is available [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/ her]. 
Note if using MPICH2 it should be compiled with "-fPIC".


== Generic Installation  ==

To install DistNumPy run the following command:

`CC="mpicc" python setup.py install --prefix /your/dir/`

And then make sure that `/your/dir/` is in your `$PYTHONPATH`.


=== Blue Gene/P (surveyor.alcf.anl.gov) ===
To install DistNumPy run the following command:



`CC="/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/comm/bin/mpicc -fno-strict-aliasing " /bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/gnu-linux/bin/python setup.py install --prefix /your/dir/`

And then submit like:

`qsub -n 2 -t 30 --mode smp --env PYTHONPATH=/your/dir/ /bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/gnu-linux/bin/python your_program.py`
