[http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/c-api.types-and-structures.html#PyArrayObject PyArrayObject]  is the fundamental data structure in NumPy. It can represent to different things:
  * An array with all needed meta-data including a pointer to the memory where the array content is located. 
  * An array-view, which also has all needed meta-data but instead of a pointer the array content, it has a pointer to a array that has the array content.
