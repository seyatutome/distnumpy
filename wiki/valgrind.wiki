#summary How to use valgrind to find invalid memory access and memory leaks.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =
[http://valgrind.org/ Valgrind] is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.

Before committing to trunk make sure that valgrind does not return any memory errors. However, both Python and NumPy returns some memory errors - it is therefore necessary to use the following approach:

1)Compile valgrind friendly version of Python.
./configure --without-pymalloc --prefix /opt/debugpython/
make OPT=-g
make install

2)Compile valgrind friendly version of DistNumPy.
CC=mpicc /opt/debugpython/bin/python setup.py build

3)Run DistNumPy with valgrind
valgrind --tool=memcheck  /opt/debugpython/bin/python test.py
