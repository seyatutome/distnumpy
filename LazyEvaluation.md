Lazy evaluation can be used for latency hiding and cache utilization. In DistNumPy lazy evaluation is implemented by the use of a [dependency graph](http://code.google.com/p/distnumpy/wiki/DependencyGraph), in which each node represents an operation. An operation is anything between the creation and destruction of whole arrays to the calculation and communication of memory blocks.
